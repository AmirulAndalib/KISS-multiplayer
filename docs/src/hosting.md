# Hosting
Hosting a server with KissMP is very easy. 

- The server software was included in your download, extract this to a folder where you would like to set up your server.
- Run the server software, it will generate a config file that you can edit.
- Edit the config.json file to set the level, player limit, whether it's public, etc.
- That's basically all there is to it.

# How do I connect to my server?
If your server is running on your own PC, connect using the address 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, follow the steps below.

# How do others connect to my server?
If your server is public, it will show in the server list, and others can just click the Connect button. Otherwise:
- If you're not using any networking software like Hamachi, people connect to your server with your public IP address. ([https://www.whatismyip.com/]([https://www.whatismyip.com/)).
- If you're using networking software like Hamachi, use the IP assigned to you by that software.

Note: You must have the port specified in config.json forwarded
